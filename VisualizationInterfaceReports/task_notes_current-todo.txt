Alex's emr-vis-nlp to-do list
(last update: mar 12)
(FYI: code available at https://github.com/omgpotatoes/emr-vis-nlp)
(FYI: open issues being tracked at https://github.com/omgpotatoes/emr-vis-nlp/issues?state=open)


document-grid view:
-- (backburner idea) on mouseover of terms in blown-up doc: highlight other docs which contain term? highlight sections of other docs that are relevant to the same issues? (or simplification: other terms that are strongly associated with whatever indicator the hovered term is)
-- (backburner idea) highlight piece of text before moving doc to indicate to back-end which terms are relevant
-- todo: finish fixing glyph auto movement wrt. boundary lines: regions too small to accomodate pieces?
-- (backburner todo) run force-layout before drawing to the screen (to eliminate jitter?)
- (lower priority) revising histogram interactions: highlight on hover, or color-code all visible docs on hover of single attr's histogram? (as opposed to individual bars)
-- (low-priority backburner) rename "skew" column
- representing multiple documents per patient:
-- idea: box around glyphs for single patient? or, patient starts as single glyph, interacting causes it to be split into constituent glyphs representing each report for patient? (constituent docs organized temporally)
- bugfix: ensure consistent attribute ordering! indicate max cert vs min cert indicators in visualization!
- (idea: possibly have a details pane for active document?)

misc:
- take the dead code out of the master, put it in another branch
- renaming indicators & vars; explicit/textual/?, inferred/? (backburner: how to display rules?)
-- for attr names: move from jtable to jtree? root -> vars, indicators, meta -> [specific attrs]
- continuing to work on documentation, general refactoring
- with respect to annotated bibliography: think about pieces of tool we're building and where it fits in with these other projects
