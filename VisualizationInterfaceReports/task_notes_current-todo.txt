(last update: mar 22)
(FYI: code available at https://github.com/omgpotatoes/emr-vis-nlp)
(FYI: open issues being tracked at https://github.com/omgpotatoes/emr-vis-nlp/issues?state=open)

document-grid view:
- (top priority) revisit layout: implement sorted-grid-within-grid layout, in place of the current scatterplot-within-grid layout
-- grid-aware distortion, to control/eliminate occlusion and disorientation
-- incorporate lightweight animation, if possible
-- keep all document text in thumbnails w/ highlights, as opposed to only including highlights
- (secondary priority) enhance interactive histograms: update histograms to indicate % included for active search query
- (secondary priority) enhance term highlighting: 
-- for active query, pulling out text snippets in which query occurs?

misc:
- (top priority) discuss interface between back-and-front-ends; refactor my ML/NLP interface, and discuss the feasibility of its implementation with Phuong
- (secondary priority) continuing to work on documentation, general refactoring
-- ensure that we have some high-level, big-picture documentation!

other low-priority items:
- rename "skew" column; possibly reorganize attribute selection table as a tree?
- renaming indicators & vars; explicit/textual/?, inferred/? 
- think about: how to display rules?
- representing multiple documents per patient; think about how to handle this?
-- idea: box around glyphs for single patient? or, patient starts as single glyph, interacting causes it to be split into constituent glyphs representing each report for patient? (constituent docs organized temporally)
- (idea: possibly have a details pane for active document?)
- keeping bibliography up-to-date: think about pieces of tool we're building and where it fits in with these other projects
