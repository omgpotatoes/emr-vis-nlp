Alex's emr-vis-nlp to-do list
(last update: mar 29)
(FYI: code available at https://github.com/omgpotatoes/emr-vis-nlp)
(FYI: open issues being tracked at https://github.com/omgpotatoes/emr-vis-nlp/issues?state=open)

primary focus:
- continue to implement nested grid view:
-- incorporate old features: drag-to-reassign, interactive highlighted text, labels for grid units
- assign glyph sizes to optimally use space
- full document summarization (ie, full contents of old popup) within zoomed glyph
-- document "summarization" with respect to given attribute: build summary based on portions of documents containing highest-rated features for target attribute (for particular attribute)

secondary foci:
- rough implementation of document-by-variable feature table, with top-rated features (for highest-probability class?) given within cell
- second refactoring of data model, ml predictor interfaces
- continuing to work on general documentation (especially high-level, big-picture!), general refactoring

other low-priority items:
- rename "skew" column; possibly reorganize attribute selection table as a tree?
- renaming indicators & vars; explicit/textual/?, inferred/? 
- think about: how to display rules?
- representing multiple documents per patient; think about how to handle this?
-- idea: box around glyphs for single patient? or, patient starts as single glyph, interacting causes it to be split into constituent glyphs representing each report for patient? (constituent docs organized temporally)
- (idea: possibly have a details pane for active document?)
- keeping bibliography up-to-date: think about pieces of tool we're building and where it fits in with these other projects
